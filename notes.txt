AUTO TONE from the manual:
The Auto option for Levels and Curves and the Auto Tone command automatically adjust the black point and white point in an image.
 This clips a portion of the shadows and highlights in each channel and maps the lightest and darkest pixels in each color channel to pure white and pure black.
 The intermediate pixel values are redistributed proportionately.
 As a result, using the Auto option or Auto Tone increases the contrast in an image because the pixel values are expanded.
 Because the Auto option and Auto Tone adjust each color channel individually, it may remove color or introduce color casts.


AUTO CONTRAST from the manual:
The Auto Contrast command adjusts image contrast automatically.
 Because Auto Contrast does not adjust channels individually, it does not introduce or remove color casts.
 It clips the shadow and highlight values in an image and then maps the remaining lightest and darkest pixels in the image to pure white and pure black .
 This makes the highlights appear lighter and shadows appear darker.


AUTO COLOR from the manual:
Auto Color adjusts the contrast and color of an image by searching the image to identify shadows, midtones, and highlights.
 By default, Auto Color neutralizes the midtones using a target color of RGB 128 gray and clips the shadowand highlight pixels by 0.5%.
 You can change these defaults in the Auto Color Correction Options dialog box.
