This program aims to be a fast solution at high-volume photo proccessing, with the ultimate goal of limiting processing times while maximizing functionality.

NOTE: This program is still very buggy and feature-incomplete


#Operation:

[Adding destinations](https://imgur.com/Dk9nJVt)

Destinations are added from the config screen. For each destination, parameters may be set such as Lightroom-like autotoning (WIP), placing a watermark, downscaling to preset resolutions, and batch-renaming photos using an association system.

From the config screen parameters may be set, and new config files made, or existing ones opened. Preloading photos onto the drive will copy photos from an SD card into a folder called TEMP in the programs current working directory.

A configuration file is automatically generated on startup, and can be edited freely as long as formatting is maintained
